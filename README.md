# ipc_synchronization
A trivial example of shared mutex and conditional variables usage for ipc synchronization

# Usage
After compilation you'll have 3 executables:
1. shared_memory_writer
2. shared_memory_reader
3. orchestrator 

You can simply start `orchestrator` and see the exchage process in a console window. 
Another way is to start `shared_memory_writer` and then `shared_memory_reader` in two separate console windows.
